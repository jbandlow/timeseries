1. Mark Thoma: Econometrics 421 [Syllabus](http://economistsview.typepad.com/economics421/winter-2010/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD15D38DC7AA3B737)

    I believe this course is about understanding what can go wrong with OLS models -- how to detect possible issues, and how to compensate for them.
    Shorter Syllabus:
    1. Describe the basic framework of OLS Models, and use them in code
    1. Define BLUE, and the required assumptions
    1. Application of basic hypothesis tests: (t-test, F-test, chi-squared test)
    1. Heteroskedasticity: Tests, estimation, and corrections
    1. Autocorrelation: Tests and corrections
    1. ARCH errors
    1. Stochastic Regressors and measurement errors
        1. Bias and consistency of an estimator
        1. IV estimators
    Then there are more sections, which I'm not sure directly fit the theme:
    1. Simultaneous equation models
    1. Multicollinearity
    1. Specification tests
    1. Qualitative and limited dependent variables (Linear prob, probit, logit models)
    1. MLEs

    Plan: This course is 19 videos, each roughly 80 minutes.  At 1.5x with pauses to digest and take notes, call it 1 hr to watch a lecture.
    Given 4 hours/week (2 watching and 2 doing) that makes this a 10 week course.

1. Time Series Analysis and Applications with R (Shumway and Stofer) [EZ pdf](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/tsaEZ.pdf)

    This book covers basic time-series analysis, and uses R to do it. The chapters are:
    1. Time Series Characteristics (22 pp)
    2. Time Series Regression and Exploratory Data Analysis (22 pp)
    3. ARIMA models (47 pp)
    4. Spectral Analysis and Filtering (35 pp)
    5. Additional topics (GARCH / Unit Root testing / Long Memory) (14 pp)

    Plan: This will involve more code than above, but I hope I can do 22 pp plus notes and coding in 4 hours. (90 min reading / notes, 2:30 for coding).
    That makes this a 6-7 week course. (1 week per chapter, 2 weeks for 3 and 4).
