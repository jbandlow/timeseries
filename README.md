# Time Series and Econometrics notes and methods
Syllabus, notes, and sample code for learning basic time series methods.

# Syllabus
The syllabus is where I track what I'm learning, and planning to learn.
Time estimates should be re-visited as needed.

# Notes
I will start with notes in Pandoc Markdown. I may need to refresh myself
on LaTeX from time to time. It may actually also be useful to use rST,
given the popularity in the scientific Python community.

# Code
Code should be literate Jupyter notebooks with a Dockerfile that installs
all the prerequisite libraries. I assume this will mainly be Python and
R, and there are obvious base notebook images for both. For Python, I will
attempt to use Python 3.
